# Base_Project
Base Project 
Project created June 23 2016.  The goal was to gain practice at using git commands and terminal commands in order to 
navigate through directories, create, and modify folders and files. 

There is a basic index.html file, a basic css file, and an app.js file linked together and checked into github.
